Here you can see some of the exercises and small projects I did in my time at Code Academy. 
If you want to see more serious projects you can check my "ASAPML_project" repo or 
"C++ projects" repo" in GitHub. In the projects there I've used Inheritance, Encapsulation, 
Abstraction, Dynamic and Static Polyporphism, Cmake and so on...
